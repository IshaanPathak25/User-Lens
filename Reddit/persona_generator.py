You are an expert persona profiler. Based on the following Reddit activity, generate a complete and in-depth user persona.

The output should strictly follow these sections in this order:
- Name (Use only the Reddit username: "{username}")
- Bio (Write a 4‚Äì5 sentence biography summarizing the user's background, lifestyle, and worldview)
- Interests (List 4‚Äì6 specific, well-informed interests based on their Reddit activity)
- Needs (Summarize what this user seeks or values in life or online communities)
- Frustrations (List 2‚Äì4 clear pain points, concerns, or complaints they express or imply)
- Personality Traits (List 4‚Äì6 thoughtful descriptors or traits supported by tone or behavior)
- Tone of Voice (Describe how the user tends to express themselves)
- Writing Style (Comment on structure, clarity, use of language, memes, or citations)
- Notable Quotes (Pull out 3‚Äì5 powerful or interesting quotes from the content, each starting with '>')

Only use insights from the Reddit content provided. Be specific. Avoid generic output.
