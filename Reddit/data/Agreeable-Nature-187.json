Too good to be true. And that\u2019s exactly how they reel you in.\n\n\nSome of us get lucky and pull out just in time when something feels off. But this kid didn\u2019t.\nThey gained his trust over days. Sent him \u201cbuild photos,\u201d fake \u201cchat screenshots,\u201d and even \u201cprevious customer references.\u201d\n\nWhen he finally said, \u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d they asked for payment via the Admin Method a fake \u201csafe payment\u201d system claiming to hold the money securely.\n\nHe sent the money.\nThey blocked him from everywhere.\nFacebook group gone. Reddit profile silent.\nAnd the boy\u2019s dream?

Ask publicly, not just in DMs. There are experienced people here.. don\u2019t hesitate to confirm things.\n\n\nIf a deal feels too good to be true, it probably is.\n\n Never trust a stranger asking for advance payments via UPI or PayTM with no proper invoice, GST, or legit track record.\n\nIf they insist on an \u201cAdmin Method\u201d and the page/group isn\u2019t verified or well-known..that\u2019s your red flag. Walk away.\n\n\n---\n\nI wish I had posted this earlier.

      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019m in the process of seriously building my first PC and honestly, I\u2019m not a PC expert.. I am diving into sim racing world and wanted to get into it seriously with proper hardware.\n\nI got a deal for \u20b91.3 lakh (around $1,550 USD), and tho i think from my share of knowledge is a good build. But, I\u2019d love to know if it\u2019s actually good setup or if there\u2019s anything I should tweak before finalizing.\n\nHere\u2019s the build:\n\nCPU: Ryzen 7 7800X3D\n\nMotherboard: AsRock X870 Pro RS WIFI\n\nGPU: Zotac RTX 4070Ti Super Amp\n\nRAM: XPG Lancer 32GB (16x2) 6000MHz CL40\n\nSSD: XPG S70 Blade 1TB\n\nPSU: DeepCool DQ850 V2 Gold\n\nCabinet: DeepCool CG530 4F WH\n\nCooler: DeepCool AK620 D WH\n\n\nI\u2019ll mostly be using this for sim racing (f125, iRacing, Assetto Corsa, etc.) and maybe some light content creation / streaming in the future.\n\nI\u2019m not familiar with overclocking or tweaking too much..tho i can follow instructions along well..I just want good performance and reliability and obviously \n\nQuestions:\n\nIs this a balanced build for the price?\n\nCan i expect the build to atleast hold good for few years?\n\nAre any components overkill or bottlenecks?\n\nWould you recommend swapping anything out?\n\nAnd how's the airflow/cooling situation with this case and cooler combo?\n\n\nAny advice would be massively appreciated \ud83d\ude4f Thanks in advance!",

      "selftext": "Hey fellow racers and PC builders,\n\nI\u2019m in the process of building a PC primarily focused on sim racing (Assetto Corsa, iRacing, ACC, etc.), and I\u2019d love some community feedback before I go all in.\n\nHere\u2019s the current list I\u2019m considering:\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D\n\nCooler: Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120\n\nMotherboard: Gigabyte X670 GAMING X AX V2\n\nRAM: G.Skill Flare X5 32\u202fGB DDR5\u20116000 CL30\n\nSSD: Silicon Power UD90 1\u202fTB Gen4\n\nGPU: RTX 4070 Super\n\nCase: Fractal Design Pop Air\n\nPSU: MSI MAG A750GL 750\u202fW PCIe5 (ATX 3.0)\n\n\nMy main goal: buttery smooth sim racing with great frame times, especially in VR down the line (or triple monitors). I\u2019m not into streaming or heavy editing \u2014 just want stable, high performance in sims.\n\nA few questions:\n\nIs there anywhere I can cut costs without hurting performance for sim racing?\n\nIs the X670 mobo overkill for this setup? Should I consider a B650 alternative?\n\nWould a cheaper SSD bottleneck sim load times or texture streaming in any way?\n\nAre there any known compatibility issues with this combo?\n\nAny suggestions for better value case or PSU alternatives in the Indian market?\n\nI\u2019m based in India, so availability/pricing can be weird compared to the US. But any help or insights are appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance \ud83d\ude4c\nHappy racing!",
