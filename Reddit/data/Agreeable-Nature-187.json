      "selftext": "Hey fellow racers and PC builders,\n\nI\u2019m in the process of building a PC primarily focused on sim racing (Assetto Corsa, iRacing, ACC, etc.), and I\u2019d love some community feedback before I go all in.\n\nHere\u2019s the current list I\u2019m considering:\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D\n\nCooler: Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120\n\nMotherboard: Gigabyte X670 GAMING X AX V2\n\nRAM: G.Skill Flare X5 32\u202fGB DDR5\u20116000 CL30\n\nSSD: Silicon Power UD90 1\u202fTB Gen4\n\nGPU: RTX 4070 Super\n\nCase: Fractal Design Pop Air\n\nPSU: MSI MAG A750GL 750\u202fW PCIe5 (ATX 3.0)\n\n\nMy main goal: buttery smooth sim racing with great frame times, especially in VR down the line (or triple monitors). I\u2019m not into streaming or heavy editing \u2014 just want stable, high performance in sims.\n\nA few questions:\n\nIs there anywhere I can cut costs without hurting performance for sim racing?\n\nIs the X670 mobo overkill for this setup? Should I consider a B650 alternative?\n\nWould a cheaper SSD bottleneck sim load times or texture streaming in any way?\n\nAre there any known compatibility issues with this combo?\n\nAny suggestions for better value case or PSU alternatives in the Indian market?\n\nI\u2019m based in India, so availability/pricing can be weird compared to the US. But any help or insights are appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance \ud83d\ude4c\nHappy racing!",
