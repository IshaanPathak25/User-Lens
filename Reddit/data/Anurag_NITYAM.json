      "selftext": "So last year we had our B1/B2 visa interview scheduled in New Delhi, India, we were to visit USCA(university of southern California) on a 10 days workshop from our college. So there were almost 20 students+ 2 teachers and we all were divided in group of 3, out of 22 people only 9 were accepted and all of our purpose of visit was same. So when we went for the interview the interviewer asked question only with my friend who was standing in the middle, she asked 1)what does our father do.\n2) what's the purpose of our visit and where is our college. The main thing I remember was my friend fumbled and over explained a little bit when asked about what his father does(His father is export manager in Kuwait and he used to live in Kuwait with his father). And the interview went on saying \"Only speak what I ask\". Other than this all the answers were fine. And the teachers who were meant to travel with us already had travel history to USA, still there visa was rejected. All the applicants who reapplied all of their visa is rejected again after the interview this year.\n\nAnd I have visa INTERVIEW AGAIN on May 13, Which is SOLO INTERVIEW.\nPlease tell me how can I make them believe that I have strong ties to my country INDIA, and give right answers in the given spam of 2-3 MIN.\n\n\nPLEASE GUIDE ME, I REALLY WANNA VISIT USA AND I'LL REALLY COME BACK, I DON'T WANNA BE REJECTED AGAIN.\n\nI DIDN'T SLEPT FOR 2 DAYS, WHEN MY VISA WAS REJECTED LAST YEAR. \ud83d\ude4f\n\nIF THERE'S AMERICAN NATIONAL HERE THEN PLEASE GUIDE ME HOW TO GIVE RIGHT INTERVIEW IN 2-3 MIN.",
